Configuring target hosts
------------------------

Modify the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml`` file to
configure the target hosts.

Do not assign the same IP address to different target hostnames.
Unexpected results may occur. Each IP address and hostname must be a
matching pair. To use the same host in multiple roles, for example
infrastructure and networking, specify the same hostname and IP in each
section.

Use short hostnames rather than fully-qualified domain names (FQDN) to
prevent length limitation issues with LXC and SSH. For example, a
suitable short hostname for a compute host might be:
``123456-Compute001``.

#. Configure a list containing at least three infrastructure target
   hosts in the ``shared-infra_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      shared-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: INFRA01_IP_ADDRESS
        603989-infra02:
          ip: INFRA02_IP_ADDRESS
        627116-infra03:
          ip: INFRA03_IP_ADDRESS
        628771-infra04: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each infrastructure target host. Use
   the same net block as bond0 on the nodes, for example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      shared-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: 10.240.0.80
        603989-infra02:
          ip: 10.240.0.81
        627116-infra03:
          ip: 10.240.0.184

#. Configure a list containing at least two infrastructure target
   hosts in the ``os-infra_hosts`` section (you can reuse
   previous hosts as long as their name and ip is consistent):

   .. code-block:: yaml

      os-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: INFRA01_IP_ADDRESS
        603989-infra02:
          ip: INFRA02_IP_ADDRESS
        627116-infra03:
          ip: INFRA03_IP_ADDRESS
        628771-infra04: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each infrastructure target host. Use
   the same net block as bond0 on the nodes, for example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      os-infra_hosts:
        603975-infra01:
          ip: 10.240.0.80
        603989-infra02:
          ip: 10.240.0.81
        627116-infra03:
          ip: 10.240.0.184


#. Configure a list containing at least one network target host in the
   ``network_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      network_hosts:
        602117-network01:
          ip: NETWORK01_IP_ADDRESS
        602534-network02: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each network target host.

#. Configure a list containing at least one compute target host in the
   ``compute_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      compute_hosts:
        900089-compute001:
          ip: COMPUTE001_IP_ADDRESS
        900090-compute002: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each compute target host.

#. Configure a list containing at least one logging target host in the
   ``log_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      log_hosts:
        900088-logging01:
          ip: LOGGER1_IP_ADDRESS
        903877-logging02: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each logging target host.

#. Configure a list containing at least one repository target host in the
   ``repo-infra_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      repo-infra_hosts:
        603975-repo01:
          ip: REPO01_IP_ADDRESS
        603989-repo02:
          ip: REPO02_IP_ADDRESS
        627116-repo03:
          ip: REPO03_IP_ADDRESS
        628771-repo04: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each repository target host.

   The repository typically resides on one or more infrastructure hosts.
   Alternatively, specify a value for the ``openstack_repo_url`` variable
   in the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_group_vars.yml`` file. The value should
   contain a URL for a host with the appropriate repository layout. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

       openstack_repo_url: "https://rpc-repo.rackspace.com/"

   Using ``repo-infra_hosts`` configures a local repository with the
   appropriate layout and sets ``openstack_repo_url`` for you.

#. Configure a list containing at least one optional storage host in the
   ``storage_hosts`` section:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      storage_hosts:
        100338-storage01:
          ip: STORAGE01_IP_ADDRESS
        100392-storage02: ...

   Replace ``*_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the ``br-mgmt``
   container management bridge on each storage target host. Each storage
   host also requires additional configuration to define the back end
   driver.

   The default configuration includes an optional storage host. To
   install without storage hosts, comment out the stanza beginning with
   the *storage\_hosts:* line.
